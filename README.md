# Harvis - Personal AI Assistant

Harvis is a personal AI assistant built using Python. It utilizes speech recognition and speech synthesis to listen for commands and provide responses.

## Features

- Speech recognition: Harvis listens for voice commands using the `speech_recognition` library.
- Command processing: It processes the recognized command and performs specific actions based on the input.
- Name detection: Harvis can detect when your name is called among the recognized commands.
- Speech synthesis: It uses the `pyttsx3` library to convert text into speech for providing responses.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/HARI-SREE-S-A/Is_my_name_called_in_meet.git
2.Dependencies:

     ```shell
      pip install pyttsx3 speechrecognition sounddevice

      python harvis.py
Usage
Harvis will greet you with a welcome message.
Speak your command clearly when prompted with "Listening for command...".
If Harvis recognizes your name among the commands, it will respond with "Your name is called."
Harvis will continue listening for commands until you manually stop the program.
Customization
You can customize Harvis to recognize different names or add more functionalities to suit your needs. Here are a few ways to customize the project:

Add additional commands: Expand the list of recognized commands and implement corresponding actions.
Customize the name list: Modify the names list in the code to include the names you want Harvis to detect.
Enhance error handling: Implement additional error handling and feedback mechanisms for better user experience.
Integrate APIs: Connect Harvis with external APIs to fetch data or perform complex tasks.
